# AWS infrastructure

Welcome to the AWS infrastructure playground, in here you will find code examples of a complete infrastructure using
the following services of AWS:

- ECS
- RDS
- S3

With the correct configuration in place, the code samples shared here are ready to be used on AWS.

## Overview

other.

Before going into AWS, letÂ´s review what the project we are using is made of and assumptions made:
